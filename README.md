## My process

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This was a fun challenge and I learned how to use state better to have all the various compoenents work togther. Granted I didn't really use "components" in this challenge. I just dumped all the methods and functions into one component called calculator. Still have a better understading of handling events and useState after this challenge.

Used a lot of ternary operators in classess and div's that were based on the state of other componenents. I couldn't get the Number of People to outline red based on a zero input. I was going to skip over it and default to one but it made the input of a custom value a bit goofy for the end user.

### Continued development

Need to get better in setting up mobile CSS. I struggled a bit with getting everything laid out correctly for the mobile view. I'm wondering if it's my intial setup of the div's.
